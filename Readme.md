# DevSecOps project
This DevSecOps pipeline manages the complete cycle of development, security, and deployment for a Netflix-style application. It starts by retrieving the code from GitHub, followed by a thorough evaluation of code quality through SonarQube and a strict quality gate assessment. Security is a top priority, with OWASP and Trivy scans checking for vulnerabilities in both dependencies and the Docker image. After these checks, the pipeline effortlessly builds, pushes, and deploys the application via Docker, with ArgoCD on taking charge of continuous deployment and management within an Azure Kubernetes environment. This automated process ensures a secure, resilient, and efficiently deployed Netflix-like application across all stages of the development lifecycle.
